## Introduction

This is a very simple cpp program which can solve the sudoku problem.

The size of the sudoku board needn't to be 9, it can be a integer which equals some integer's square.

Such as 4(2x2), 16(4x4)...



## Running Environment

### OS

Ubuntu 20.04 LTS

### Language

C++

## How to Use

Using command "make" in the src folfer to compile in linux and macos.

Using command "make clean" in src folder to remove all output files in the src folder.

If you're using a windows machine, use this command in poweshell or cmd(you need install g++ and add it into your path first):

g++ display.cpp isvalid.cpp main.cpp sudokusolver.cpp -o sodoku

to compile.

In src folder.

See in other files in folder src.

I wrote some comments in the code.
